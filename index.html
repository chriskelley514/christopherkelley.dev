      <h2>Welcome</h2>
      <p>
        I am a results-driven IT professional with a strong foundation in cybersecurity, systems administration, and software development. 
		With hands-on experience supporting enterprise environments, developing secure applications, and managing network operations, I bring a practical, security-conscious approach to technology. 
		I have maintained academic excellenceâ€”holding a near-4.0 GPA in both my Bachelor of Applied Science in Computer Information Systems Technology from Eastern Florida State College and a Professional Certificate in Cyber Defense from the University of Central Florida, all while completing real-world projects that apply industry frameworks like NIST and OWASP. 
		Adept in scripting, troubleshooting, and deploying technical solutions, I am prepared to contribute value in roles demanding both technical depth and clear communication. 
		Currently, I am advancing toward Security+ and Network+ certifications and am ready to join a team that values security, innovation, and continuous learning.
